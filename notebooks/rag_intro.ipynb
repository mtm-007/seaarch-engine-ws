      "\t* Example: `root = ET.parse('file.xml').getroot()`\n",
      "2. **JSON parsing**:\n",
      "\t* Use the `json` module to parse JSON documents.\n",
      "\t* Example: `data = json.load(open('file.json'))`\n",
      "3. **HTML parsing**:\n",
      "\t* Use the `html.parser` module to parse HTML documents.\n",
      "\t* Example: `from html.parser import HTMLParser; parser = HTMLParser(); parser.feed('file.html')`\n",
      "4. **PDF parsing**:\n",
      "\t* Use the `PyPDF2` library to parse PDF files.\n",
      "\t* Example: `pdf = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader('file.pdf'); pages = pdf.numPages`\n",
      "5. **Microsoft Office document parsing**:\n",
      "\t* Use the `python-docx` library to parse Word documents (.docx).\n",
      "\t* Use the `openpyxl` library to parse Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx).\n",
      "\t* Use the `python-odf` library to parse OpenDocument files (.odt, .ods, .odg).\n",
      "6. **Text parsing**:\n",
      "\t* Use the `csv` module to parse comma-separated values (CSV) files.\n",
      "\t* Use the `re` module to parse text files using regular expressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some popular libraries for document parsing in Python are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `xml.etree.ElementTree`: parsing XML documents\n",

      "9. `re`: parsing text files using regular expressions\n",
      "\n",
      "When parsing document files, you may need to consider the following:\n",

      "1. **Character encoding**: ensure that you're using the correct character encoding scheme (e.g., UTF-8) to handle non-ASCII characters.\n",
      "2. **Syntax errors**: handle any syntax errors that may occur during parsing, such as invalid XML or JSON structure.\n",
      "3. **Data validation**: validate the parsed data to ensure it matches your expectations.\n",

      "Solution: Refer to this stackoverflow question. Basically install jupyter and ipykernel using pipenv. And then register the kernel with `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my-virtualenv-name` inside the Pipenv shell. If you are using Jupyter notebooks in VS Code, doing this will also add the virtual environment in the list of kernels.\n",
