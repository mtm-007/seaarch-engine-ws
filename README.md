# seaarch-engine-ws

## implementing in Memory search Engine
- used codespace for contained virtual env
- started all the way from sparse bag of words for exact word match while using cosine similarity score, then to using SVD for reduced dim -> dense vector embeddings
- Using the cosine similarity score created an indices for the ranked documents 

## Elastic search
- practical use case...

## Using Codspaces
- as this project uses codespaces the library dependencies in the requirements.txt is a long list, most are pre-configured by codespace
