## implementing in Memory search Engine
- used codespace for contained virtual env
- started all the way from sparse bag of words for exact word match while using cosine similarity score, then to using SVD for reduced dim -> dense vector embeddings
- Using the cosine similarity score created an indices for the ranked documents 

## Elastic search
- practical use case
